A class in programming defines a new abstract data type. A class is the formal implementation, or blueprint, of the attributes and behaviors of an object.

When you create objects or instances of a class in coding, you create new variables or objects of that class data type.

class:  A program entity that represents a tempplate for a new type of objects.
object/instance: an entity that combines attributes (data) and behaviors(methods).

OOP: Programs that perform their behavior as interactions between objects. Java is object-oriented. 

EX: The iPod class provides the template or blueprint for the attributes(data) and behavior(methods) of an ipod object.
Its attributes or data can include the current song, current volume and battery life.
Its behavior or methods vary

Signature: name of constructor and its parameter list.

Usually, the constructor that has no parameter (sometimes called the default constructor) initializes the object to some default values, for example, zeroes.   

Static method: belongs to the class; individual objects cannot change it. 
nonstatic (instance) method: allows individual objects to modify its contents based on what their data fields have defined.

Application class: class with the main method inside of it.
main method is the beginning point of running any program. you can call a static method from another method in the same enclosing class directly without referencing the name or object of the class. 

Method signature for a method consists of the method name and the ordered, possibly empty, list of parameter types.
