Static methods: Math class has many useful static methods. Class is part of the java.lang package

Math methods:

int abs(int x)
double abs(double x)

double pow(double base, double exponent): returns the value of the first parameter raised to the power of the second parameter
Math.pow(2,3)=8

double sqrt(double x): returns the postitive square root of a double value
double random(): returns a random double value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less that 0.0 

how to increase math random range: math.random()*3+5 range is now 5-8
math methods do not print to the console therefore one must store and print.
